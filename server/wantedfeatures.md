# A list of things I want and will hopefully code one day

- User deactiviations:
    Instead of being deleted and being removed forever a user is marked as deactivated. Users who don't use the service for 4 months are also deactivated. Deactivated accounts are kept for 6 months further until being deleted completely. I'm not certain whether that will mean all the user's posts go with them? Maybe they're kept for nostalgia or something? That user name is reserved forever though to ensure that no new account has access to the users entries. Entries should be archived and should the deleted/activated user ever decide to log back in they will be provided with a different UI that allows them to restore or download their archive.

- Entry Analysis: 
    Running on some type of schedule or perhaps even on demand I would like a service that analyses all or some subset of a users posts to determine things like most often used words or common entry times. I believe this would be somewhat interesting and of personal value to myself
